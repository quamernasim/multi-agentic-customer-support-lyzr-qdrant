    "description": "Our Return and Exchange Policy allows customers to return or exchange eligible items within 7 days of delivery. To qualify, the item must be unused, unwashed, and in its original packaging with all tags intact. For electronics and high-value items, the product should be sealed and unopened. Once a return request is initiated, our logistics team will schedule a pickup within 2-4 working days. After inspection of the returned item, we will either issue a replacement or process a refund as per the customer’s request. Please note that certain product categories such as personal care, lingerie, customized products, and perishable goods are non-returnable unless received damaged or defective. Items damaged due to misuse or mishandling will not be accepted. Our exchange option is limited to size and color variations of the same product, subject to stock availability. If an exchange is not possible, a refund will be issued as per our Refund Policy. The company reserves the right to deny any return if the returned product does not meet our quality guidelines.",

For partial refunds due to damaged items or shipping discrepancies, the refunded amount will correspond to the value of the affected product(s) only. In rare cases, if refund processing is delayed due to bank or payment gateway issues, we request customers to allow 2 additional business days before escalation. Refunds for promotional discounts or coupon-based purchases will exclude the coupon value unless explicitly mentioned. If a refund fails due to incorrect payment details provided by the customer, we may require verification documents for re-processing. Refund requests related to fraudulent activity, suspicious returns, or excessive returns from a single account may be reviewed and declined as per our Fraud Prevention Guidelines.",

Once an order is dispatched, customers will receive a tracking ID via email and SMS, allowing them to track their shipment in real-time. Please ensure accurate address details are provided to avoid delivery issues. Our logistics partners will attempt delivery twice before the package is returned to our warehouse. Reshipment charges will apply for orders returned due to failed delivery attempts caused by incorrect or incomplete addresses.",

We do not accept cheques, demand drafts, or any form of credit/debit card payments during COD delivery. COD orders cannot be modified once placed.

Frequent cancellations may trigger account review and temporary suspension of certain order privileges. For customized or made-to-order products, cancellations must be made within 12 hours of placing the order as production begins immediately.
