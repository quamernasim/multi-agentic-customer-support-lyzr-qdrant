    "content": "Returning a product is simple through our online returns portal. Log in to your account, go to 'My Orders', and select the item you wish to return. Click 'Return/Exchange' and choose a reason from the dropdown menu (e.g., damaged, incorrect item, size issue). You will be prompted to upload photos if the product is defective or damaged. Once submitted, our team will verify your request within 24-48 hours. After approval, a reverse pickup will be scheduled, typically within 2-4 business days. Ensure the product is securely packed in its original packaging with all tags and accessories intact. Once the item reaches our warehouse and passes quality inspection, a refund or exchange will be processed as per your preference. Please note that certain items such as personal hygiene products, perishables, and customized goods are non-returnable. This step-by-step approach ensures a smooth return experience for all customers.",

    "content": "Refunds are issued once a returned product passes quality checks or when an order is canceled before shipping. Refunds for prepaid orders are processed back to the original payment method (card, wallet, or UPI) within 5-7 business days. COD refunds are processed via bank transfer or store credit. If a refund is delayed, it is typically due to bank processing timelines, which can vary. We recommend checking your bank account statement and contacting your bank if delays persist. Refund confirmations are sent via email and SMS for transparency. For partial refunds, such as when an item is missing or damaged, we calculate the refund based on the affected item value only. Our refund policy ensures customer trust while maintaining robust fraud-prevention measures to safeguard transactions.",
